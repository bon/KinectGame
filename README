Project for Games and Learning course - AUC 2013

TO DO:

Fire click events on pull / push of the Kinect (code contains test version)
Update Score depending on time
Animation/sound when hitting the fuzzy creature


Refactoring:
Make the table width and height dependent on screen size (for projectors etc)


To Decide:

How to manage pull/push in one movement.
    - if we only allow push then no feedback on pull
    - if we allow both then need to distinguish better (Breanndan's code?)
