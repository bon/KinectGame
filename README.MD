Project for Games and Learning course - AUC 2013

TO DO:

Fire click events on pull / push of the Kinect
Update Score depending on time
Animation/sound when hitting the fuzzy creature


Refactoring:
Take Kinect code out of HTML file.
Make the table width and height dependent on screen size (for projectors etc)
Take CSS code out of HTML file
Put level dependent code back into HTML, create one HTML file per level.


To Decide:

How to manage pull/push in one movement.
    - if we only allow push then no feedback on pull
    - if we allow both then need to distinguish better (Breanndan's code?)
